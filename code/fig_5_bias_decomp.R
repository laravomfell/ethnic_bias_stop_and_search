# This script reproduces Figure 5 in the main text,
# showing the overall bias decomposition as violin plots

# Our original script includes the construction of the force-level disparities
# file based on our data. Since we cannot make those files available, 
# we instead provide the final numbers in the 'force_level.csv'
# file loaded at the beginning.

# We then obtain the posterior draws for p_theta (search shares) and 
# rho (patrol shares) and then calculate the 3 terms (officer bias, 
# patrol ratio, search ratio) for each draw

# Lastly, we calculate the medians labeled on the figure.
